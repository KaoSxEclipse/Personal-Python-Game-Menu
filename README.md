Advanced Menu Screen for my Python Games / Code 

I recently started learning python and making games off tutorials and online docs. This is my first large-ish project all on my own without following a tutorial directly. Feel free to offer advice! I'll most likely end up publishing the game code as well so anyone who wants to download this all can play!
